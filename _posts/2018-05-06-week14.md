## Course Reflections

### What did I learn  
This course has been really informative on open source projects. I learned about:
 - Basics of contributing to an Open Source project
 - Certain git stuff that I wasn't aware of
 - The history of Open Source
 - Triaging
 - Linux basics, including shell commands
 - The different software licenses
 - And more about different companies, such as Google and their open source projects, Mozilla and their purpose, Redhat and how they generate revenue, etc.
  
### What I wish I had learned
I think the materials I've learned thus far are great for introducing ourselves to open source. If I had something else I wanted to learn, I guess it'd be more about Linux. I've been using windows for the longest time ever, and Linux seems like a widely-used OS for most developers. Knowing more about the shell commands is great, but knowing how to use linux as a whole would have been awesome (albeit time-consuming!)  

### What would I remove from the course?
I would probably remove the 20 points contribution requirement -- that's just too much. I'd maybe tone it down to 15. 

### What would I add to the course?
More speakers... with freebies. I really enjoyed days where the speakers would come in and talk about their experiences with open source projects. It has been informative and really gives insight into the company's efforts with open source.
