### Questions for Danna for Tuesday
- How do you contribute to Open Source?
- What are your favorite Open Source projects that you contribute to? 
- What are some Open Source projects that you currently use? 

### Project progress 

For the project, we found an issue (actually a feature request)that seemed to be within our capabilities. There was even a version update of moment that released a similar feature, and we can use that as a reference point. For now, my specific task is to familiarize myself with that version update so that I know where to direct my efforts on. 


### Additional contributions

- [Raised a PR that resolves issue #96](https://github.com/joannakl/cs480_s18/pull/101)
