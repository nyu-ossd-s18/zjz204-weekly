### Project progress 

For the project, we were able to implement the feature request. I fixed some of Dan's initial commits for the feature and added some missing properties, such as the string format for week(s).   
  
Afterwards, we started to provide test coverage for the feature. Some of the test cases did not pass, and after much headache, I was able to figure out the source of that problem. It turns out that in order to properly implement this new feature, we would also need to revise the original algorithm the source code uses to figure out the duration with the relative time threshold set by users.
