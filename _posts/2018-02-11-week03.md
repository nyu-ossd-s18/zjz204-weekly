#### How you selected the article to contribute to

  These past few days, I've had some runny poo (presumably from a lack of fiber-rich food). To fix this, I ingested some Metamucil mixture. I was curious about my condition as well as what Metamucil is, so I googled it up. The very first link was a Wikipedia entry on Fibre supplements. 
  

#### What the contribution was

   I noticed that one of the section was missing references (the part about the consequences of taking too much fibre), so I wanted to confirm if any of the section was true. I looked through articles and research papers and found that all of the references that I found agreed with the wikipedia text, so I thought I'd link the articles and research papers that I found as a source.
